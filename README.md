# Cloud-1_WeThinkCode
The purpose of this project was to demostrate the student's knowledge in cloud infrustracture by hosting a wordress
website either using AWS Cloud services, Google Cloud Services or Microsoft Azure Cloud Services.

A couple of the AWS services where used for this project being the Elastic BeanStalk Architecture, RDS service and the Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
Elastic Beanstalk Architecture was used to create the web environment for the project.You can quickly deploy and manage applications with Elastic Beanstalk
in the AWS Cloud and the AWS will handle most of things for you, you can make changes on your preference on how the site should be handle by the AWS Cloud.
RDS service was used which made it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity
while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups.
Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) was used, this was mainly for storing images on the AWS platform.
